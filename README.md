# Ultra-Large-Scale-Structure
A game engine implementation of physical cosmology structure formation with a compute shader.

The current research focus of this (extreme programming) simulation is how dark matter, namely, the absence of dark matter would affect the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy, with a very specific focus. The simulation aims to provide a dial to turn the dark matter up or down, and watch the effect on the formation of the galaxy. The simulation makes the implicit assumption that a standard dark matter universe has persisted conveniently up until our simulation begins.
