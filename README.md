# Ultra-Large-Scale-Structure
A game engine implementation of physical cosmology structure formation with a compute shader.

The current research focus of this simulation is how dark matter, namely, the absence of dark matter would affect the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy, with a very specific focus. The simulation aims to provide a dial to turn the dark matter up or down, and watch the effect on the formation of the galaxy. The simulation makes the implicit assumption that a standard dark matter universe has persisted conveniently up until our simulation begins.
